`It was then when I realized that the crow not only recognized my face, but it also was able to describe my face to the other crows. What else does he know about me? Does he understand how I feel?` How does he know when I'm angry? Is he telling the other crows that I'm pissed off? Or that I'm in a good mood? Could he really be describing my feelings to the other crows? And if so, what do the other crows feel when they hear what my crow friend is saying about me?

This was a new twist to my day. I have read that crows are among the smartest animals on the planet. But my day suddenly was elevated from awesome to spectacular as I turned the corner and there were about 10 more crows waiting for me. I smiled and said, "Hello everyone, what a great day today is! And you all look sooooo happy today!" (Well, I was thinking it, but it would've been kinda silly to say it out loud.)

The crows spread out on the telephone wires above me and a couple flew off. Then they all started cawing in perfect harmony. Not a single discordant note in the whole bunch. It was absolutely beautiful! I love crows, especially when they sing their song. And it made me love life that much more. It reminded me of something that happened to me years ago when I was walking down the street, and about 20 crows came and followed me, staying about 10 feet in front of me. They just kept cawing and cawing until I had to stop. I stood there and listened to them for about 10 minutes. It was one of the most memorable moments of my life. I had heard about a lot of bizarre things about crows, but never thought I would experience it firsthand. This was it! No doubt about it. These guys were on their way to a concert! I was just lucky enough to be a part of the audience! They finally flew away and I walked down the rest of the street, head bobbing with every footstep. I was in heaven!
