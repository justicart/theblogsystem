`This is an introduction to a new blog written by AI about` random things.

So don’t expect any profound posts like this one.

Anyways, lately I’ve been thinking about the amount of stuff I own. You’re probably thinking, why on earth would you think about that? Well I do have a pretty good reason. (For all you bored people who just want to skip the long boring intro) it’s a nice looking game (somewhat like tetris except with letters instead of blocks). Go try it out.

There I was minding my own business, downloading this game and I came across this page. Now the “about us” section of their about us page seems pretty pointless. Except for the fact that it includes this very useful quote: “Think of these cards as train tickets. What would you do if you didn’t have a ticket? Get a $50 ticket to go to a school dance? Of course not. But now with a Wild Card you can. So buy a $50 ticket to the dance (or whatever else you might want) and you have a better chance of going.”

Now, you can clearly see the irony of the quote and the concept of the game. If you can’t afford a ticket you can’t get to the place where you’re having a good time.

Anyway back to what I was saying. I’ve always seen this crazy amount of clutter and I never really questioned it. Now all of a sudden, I think I have way to much stuff.

When I was really young, I’d always dream of going on vacation or going to my friends houses to visit. Then I’d wake up and be forced to start my morning routine and all my plans to travel go out the window. I’d get in the car, and travel for 1/2 an hour. I would be too tired to say anything and listen to my brother and parents argue about politics and watch the dumbest movies (yes that’s plural). We’d arrive at school at 7:30. I’d get to school and get in to the elevator where people would talk about things I don’t care about. All I want to do is sleep. Then I’d walk to my first class. I’d get to school at 7:45 and have until 8:30 to sleep. If I didn’t get at least an hour of sleep by then, I wouldn’t be able to focus in class. So I’d give up and do what I do in class, daydream about being somewhere else.

You can see the problem with my life right? I don’t have a life. Not much anyway. I think that the real problem is my self control and my parents always buying me whatever I ask for. I used to think this was a good thing. The big trip to the mall I’ve been wanting for months, the new computer or game I really want to play. I thought this was good. You should be happy that your parents care so much about you. But lately I’ve been thinking, what good is this? Nothing but junk I’ll never use or want. So this brings me back to my original question. What can I do with this junk? You probably didn’t think I’d actually have an answer for you. But I do.

After reading this blog (which isn’t long) I would hope you would be inspired to go and take a look at your junk. Maybe you’ll think you don’t have that much. Or you can compare yourself to me. Maybe you’ll realize just how much you have and how much you could do. Either way, you can do something with this blog and you’ll always be glad you did.
