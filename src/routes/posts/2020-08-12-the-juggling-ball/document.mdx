`Bill is a juggling ball. He has a couple brothers that he performs with. This is a story about their last performance, as told by Bill.`

`It started around 6 p.m. on Friday. I was the first juggling ball to be thrown in the air. The juggler caught me just as he threw my brother, Ed.` He threw me a little higher and then caught me again. He did this until he threw my brother, Jack. He was a really good juggler. He could juggle 3 balls at a time. I always wondered how he did that. Then, he would throw me and I would hit Jack. It hurt. I didn’t like being thrown that high. Then, the juggler threw my brother, Larry. He was a little different than us. He was smaller, and his head was kind of flat. He was the best juggler. He could juggle 4 balls at a time. He was very good. The juggler threw me up again. I was starting to get dizzy. Then, I heard the audience cheer. I didn’t know why. I couldn’t see what was going on. I guess the juggler was about to catch me. I was right. He caught me. I was dizzy, but he didn’t throw me back up. He just stood there. I was wondering why. Then, I heard my brothers yelling. They were yelling at the juggler. They told him to throw me. I didn’t know why. I was dizzy. I could barely hear them. The juggler stood there. Then, he threw me back up. I was so dizzy. I started spinning. Then, I saw my brothers. They were getting closer to me. I was spinning so fast that I couldn’t see them. Then, I heard the audience cheering again. I knew that they were cheering for me. I was so dizzy. I couldn’t tell where I was. I felt like I was going to fall. Then, I hit the floor. I was on my back. I couldn’t see anything. I felt something on my back. I couldn’t tell what it was. I felt like I was going to die. Then, I heard a voice. It was a voice that I hadn’t heard before. It was a man’s voice. I was so dizzy that I couldn’t hear him. I could only hear the voice that I heard before. It was my mother’s voice. She was telling me that I had to go to sleep. She was telling me that I had to get better. She was telling me that I had to stop spinning. I didn’t want to stop spinning. I was so dizzy. Then, I saw my brothers. They were crying.
