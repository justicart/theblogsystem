`This is a story like Romeo and Juliet but with Star Trek characters. Here is goes.` Read and find out who Spock ends up with in the end and why.

Kirk had been watching Spock and Uhura from the corner of his eye. There was a small flicker of jealousy between them. He knew Uhura was taken to Vulcan for a long time, and Spock was on Earth with Jim. Their flirting and arguing was different from the other two, because they have shared emotions, but he didn't know if it would ever come to anything. Spock was a Vulcan and Uhura was Vulcan and human. He knew there were bound to be complications. He would need to watch them closely if they were to end up together.

"How would you like some coffee?" Jim asked from behind Spock as he approached them. Spock turned and saw Kirk and he gave Jim a little smirk.

"I would love some coffee. Thank you." Spock said.

"How about you, Lt. Uhura?" Jim said as he held out the tray to Uhura.

"Coffee would be lovely, Captain." Uhura said with a smile.

"Lt. Uhura, can I ask you something?" Jim said as they headed to the table.

"Of course, what is it?" Uhura said.

"I heard your human father died." Jim said as he put the cups on the table.

"Yes, a few weeks ago. He had a stroke and he was gone before we got him to the hospital." Uhura said.

"It must have been difficult for you." Jim said.

"It was, he was everything to me. He was everything to my family." Uhura said with a tear running down her cheek.

"I'm sorry, Lt. Uhura." Jim said.

"Thank you, Captain, it was nice talking to you. I've got to go back to work." Uhura said as she got up and quickly left the room. Jim looked over at Spock.

"Was that too much?" Jim asked.

"Not at all, Jim." Spock said.

"She didn't have to tell me, you know." Jim said.

"She did." Spock said.

"Oh?" Jim said.

"She was in a Vulcan mind meld with me when we were at the hospital. I learned how the Fati were made." Spock said.

"Why didn't you tell me?" Jim said.

"There was no reason to. It was not important." Spock said.

"So why is it important now?" Jim asked.

"Because you just learned her father died." Spock said.

"I don't understand. Why does that make it important that you tell me? If you don't tell me when I ask, how am I supposed to know? Spock, what happened to you?" Jim said.

"I…I spent the last three days in a dream with Lt. Uhura. We…made love." Spock said.

"Excuse me?" Jim said.

"You heard me, I made love with Lt. Uhura." Spock said.

"Did you two have a fight?" Jim said.

"No, we made love." Spock said.

"Are you saying that you and Lt. Uhura had a sexual relationship?" Jim said.

"We had a Vulcan mind meld, and the ritual led to us sharing something different. She took me to Earth, and we made love there." Spock said.

"So did you and Uhura get married?" Jim asked.

"No, we did not." Spock said.

"Then you had sex with her?" Jim said.

"We had sexual intercourse." Spock said.

"Did you use protection?" Jim asked.

"We did." Spock said.

"So then you had sex and she told you her father died." Jim said.

"Yes, Jim, the woman we had sex with had just lost her father." Spock said.

"Then it was the right thing to tell me." Jim said.

"What we shared in the mind meld was different. I could never love her the way I love you. She has the most amazing man on Earth, I do not think I could ever take that man's place in her heart. I learned today that he died, and her reaction was that of a Vulcan that had lost the object of his life." Spock said.

"So do you regret what happened?" Jim said.

"No, I have learned that humans and Vulcans are different. Our minds and our bodies are different." Spock said.

"Are you okay?" Jim said.

"I am fine." Spock said.

"I know you're lying." Jim said.

"And I know that you're frustrated with this issue." Spock said.

"Yes, I am. I do not understand why you do not tell me everything that goes on with you. We do not have secrets in a relationship, Spock." Jim said.

"Perhaps you should find one for this." Spock said.

"I would never have sex with you, and then walk out and talk to you about it!" Jim said.

"I have not known you to walk out of a conversation before, but I do not doubt that you are capable of it." Spock said.

"You know what? I'm not even going to continue this conversation. I am leaving, and I am coming back when you are ready to be an adult." Jim said.

"Jim." Spock said.

"Not now, Spock." Jim said as he walked out of the room.

Spock was still at the table when Jim returned after dinner. He turned to Spock with a stern look on his face. He put down his tray and sat across from Spock. He leaned in a little closer.

"You know, for someone with a great ability to put on a Vulcan façade, you sure can't do the same thing for a human façade. Do you not understand how much I care about you?" Jim said.

"I understand." Spock said.

"I thought I had made myself clear. I want to know what you are feeling, even if it hurts me." Jim said.

"I do not want to hurt you." Spock said.

"I know you don't. It is your intention to be honest and open, it's your actions that have betrayed you. You should not hide your feelings from me." Jim said.

"I would never do that." Spock said.

"Then why do I feel like you do?" Jim said.

"Because I know you." Spock said.

"Then you should know better." Jim said.

"There are many things I do not know, and many things that I have yet to learn. I have been a disappointment to you, have I not?" Spock said.

"No, you haven't. Spock, that isn't what I meant." Jim said.

"What I mean is, you did not expect that a human and a Vulcan would fall in love, and that the captain would fall in love with him. Neither did I expect to fall in love with you." Spock said.

"You never told me that." Jim said.

"I am telling you now." Spock said.

"You know, Spock, I have been hiding from Uhura that I have been in love with you since I was a first year cadet. I knew there were complications, as you say, but the heart wants what the heart wants." Jim said.

"What do you suggest, Jim?" Spock asked.

"I suggest we go back to the room, and discuss what we're going to do about it." Jim said.

"In your quarters?" Spock asked.

"Yes." Jim said.

"I would be pleased to discuss that with you." Spock said.

"Let's go." Jim said.

They walked to Jim's quarters, stopping by to pick up drinks. Jim's quarters were small, one bedroom, one living room, one bathroom, but they were all Jim needed. Spock pulled Jim's shirt off while Jim unbuttoned Spock's shirt. Jim pushed Spock to the bed, stopping for a moment to take in the vision that was in front of him.

"I have never felt such emotions." Spock said.

"And?" Jim asked.

"I have never felt these emotions before." Spock said.

"You do not feel what you feel for me is love?" Jim asked.

"I believe that is the correct term for the emotion." Spock said.

"Then what are you feeling?" Jim asked.

"I am feeling the same as you. I love you, Jim." Spock said.

"So, you have not been in love with Uhura?" Jim asked.

"Uhura and I have known each other since we were children. I was married to her for six years. There are feelings, and there is love." Spock said.

"And this is love?" Jim asked.

"Yes." Spock said.

"I love you too, Spock." Jim said.

"We have feelings and we have love. Now what do we do about it?" Spock asked.

"We move to the Enterprise. We go to Vulcan. We live happily ever after." Jim said.

"That sounds like a plan." Spock said.

"Do you think that maybe you and Uhura will have a romantic thing that goes on for all of our lifetimes?" Jim asked.

"It is possible. I do not see why not." Spock said.

"I will keep an eye on them." Jim said.

"That is logical." Spock said.

"The feeling is overwhelming, but the heart wants what the heart wants." Jim said.

"Agreed." Spock said.

"Good. Now, let's go join our families and friends for our wedding. I can't wait to show off my soon to be husband." Jim said.

"Agreed." Spock said.

The two of them got dressed, walked to the mess hall, ate, and then went to engineering to meet their friends and families. Jim and Spock got married by the captain of the USS Enterprise. That is how it ends. I will add some romance if it goes in that direction. This is a suggestion that I have had for some time, and thought I should put it on here.
