`Today was the day the seeds came. No one knows where they came from, they just showed up all over. Who sent them? Why?` No one knows.



Scattered like windblown rain over the continent. East to west, north to south, over mountains, over oceans, seeds for fruit trees, vineyards, herbs and nuts and berries and corn. Wherever the seeds blew, they landed and there they grew.



It was a gift for all, a gift that enriched all, a gift that nourished all. A gift without cost to any man.



Yet the men and women of the Council called it a "Pandora Seed." They claimed it was a plague. They claimed that the seeds came from outside, that they had no understanding of where the seeds came from or why they grew. The Council believed that the seeds would destroy them, because the Council did not understand that the seeds were a gift.



They were afraid. The Council was afraid of losing power. They were afraid that they would no longer be needed. They were afraid that other men would no longer have to fear them. So they decided that they would destroy the seeds. They destroyed all the seeds that the people planted.



The people of the world were angry, the people of the world were upset. They could not understand why the seeds had been destroyed.



The Council had to explain to the people why they had destroyed the seeds. They told the people that they had to protect them, they told the people that if the seeds were allowed to grow, they would destroy the people. That this gift of fruit, nuts, berries, corn and herbs would destroy the people.



It was a lie.



Some of the people did not believe the Council, some of the people did not believe that the Council had destroyed the seeds. They continued to plant and tend the seed, just in case.



The Council caught these men and women, they held the men and women in the prisons and the camps. They killed the men and women who continued to plant and tend the seeds.



Others of the people gave up hope, they did not want to take the chance that they would be caught and killed. They ceased to plant and tend the seeds.



After a while, those who continued to plant and tend the seeds and those who had ceased to plant and tend the seeds looked different. Those who continued to plant and tend the seeds, their eyes showed fear, uncertainty. They were living as if the Council was watching them, listening to their conversations.



Those who had ceased to plant and tend the seeds were living their life without fear. They did not have to hide the seed from the Council. They could live their lives. Their eyes showed sadness, they were not as hopeful as they were before. Their eyes reflected the desolation they felt at the loss of the gift of the seed.



The Council lived in fear.



Fear that the people would revolt. Fear that the people would run to the leaders who had not destroyed the seed.



The Council ordered the destruction of all crops, all seeds. Those who were caught with the seed were killed. The Council proclaimed that any found with the seed would be killed. They feared that the people would come after them. They feared that they would lose their power.



The people could not understand why the Council would do what they had done, they could not understand why the Council would kill the people, they could not understand why the Council would kill those who planted the seed.



Why would they do this?



The people started to gather in the cities, in the villages. They came out of the fields, they came out of the cities. They came out of their hiding places. They came together, they gathered together in the cities, in the villages. They stopped hiding.



The Council was not prepared. They did not have enough of their soldiers to keep control of the cities, the villages. They had to release the prisons, the camps, they had to release those whom they had imprisoned and in many cases they had to kill those whom they had released.



They could not keep control of the people.



The people started to run. They ran out of the cities, they ran out of the villages. They ran away from the cities, they ran away from the villages. They ran away from the Council, they ran away from the soldiers. They ran away from the camps, they ran away from the prisons. They ran away from the Council's authority, they ran away from the Council's laws, they ran away from the Council's punishment.



And they began to plant and tend the seeds. They planted and tended the seeds, no matter where they were, no matter what it took, no matter what the danger, no matter what the cost.



It was their gift. It was the gift of the seed. It was a gift to all of them, to all of the people. It was the gift of the seed, the gift of the garden.



It was the gift of the soil.



It was the gift of freedom.



It was the gift of choice.



It was the gift of joy.



It was the gift of life.



It was the gift of living in a free society. It was the gift of a free people. It was the gift of hope, it was the gift of growth, it was the gift of love.



It was the gift of all.



The people planted and tended the seed. They lived in freedom.



It is my hope that one day, all men and women will live freely, grow in the abundance of love, joy, freedom, choice, hope, and happiness. All men and women will live in peace.



It is my hope that one day, all people will plant and tend the seed, whatever it takes, whatever the cost. It is my hope that all people will live in peace.



It is my hope that one day, all people will live in freedom.



The gift of the seed.





The End
