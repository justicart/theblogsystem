`They found out that putting people that had vertigo into the gravitron at the fair, were cured.` So that was really interesting. People had vertigo and instead of using medication, put them in the gravitron, and they got better.

Now, I would not do that, but who knows. I never saw that study. There might be something to it, because it’s kind of interesting. We’ve been looking into it and a lot of people with vertigo have been put into the machine and some get worse, some get better. So it might be helping those with vertigo, but they never studied it.

The Army did a lot of research on the stress field. I was surprised to find that they had these military training courses and they had an area they called “stress field” and they were taking the soldiers and putting them in this field and training them. The soldier’s bodies are supposed to change over time and create an electromagnetic field. They are training those soldiers so that they can go into battle and get to higher consciousness levels. They wanted the field to make them super people.

We have lots of documentation on that. You know what that did, a lot of them died because they couldn’t handle the stress field. They sent them into battle and some of them just couldn’t handle it. So the stress field does create change, but it might be too much.

You said your cousin committed suicide in the time. Is there any connection?

Nope. My cousin didn’t commit suicide. But we do believe that there is something to do with the body coming into the time where people are going to die. Now it doesn’t necessarily mean you are going to die, but that your body might be coming into the field and a lot of us are starting to notice that a lot of us are getting sick and not sure why, we just feel it in our bones.

When I was in Ireland at Stonehenge, in Ireland they have the holy site of Newgrange, they are also having a shift. I started feeling bad in Newgrange. I had a whole series of things happen to me there. I did it with friends and one of my friends just turned grey over the period of a day, like she had gone into a time shift.

I know a lot of people are feeling a shift. When the Earth is going through a shift, the sun is going through a shift, the moon is going through a shift. And there is a lot of shifts going on, that doesn’t mean you are going to die, it just means you are going to change.

Do you believe this time is the end of the Mayan calendar?

I do believe it is the end of the Mayan calendar. For one thing they didn’t even have calendars. The Mayan calendar just happened to be the one calendar that most people could understand. They have talked about the pyramid with the nine steps and the Mayan calendar is the bottom.

The Mayan calendar isn’t the calendar of the new time. It doesn’t mean we are at the end of the Mayan calendar. It’s just the time period that is coming into it. You have different Mayan calendars, so you are going to have different time periods. So the time is coming, but we are also shifting out of the sun from the Earth. I think we are going into a new time period, but it might be a step along the way.

What are the dangers in entering this time?

I think the biggest danger is that you are going to have a nervous breakdown if you start getting ill. And it does seem to get better the longer you are there.

Is there a sudden and dramatic physical change that one can detect by looking at a person, or is it more subtle?

It is subtle. What you start to see is people going grey. I haven’t seen anybody turn grey, but you might see grey in their hair. It is subtle. I think people notice they are getting ill and feel more sick, but it doesn’t necessarily mean they are going to die, that might be changing, it might be to get a high, but I don’t know.

Are there any things one should do in this time period to avoid problems?

Do yoga. If you start feeling bad go to the ground, do some yoga. Go into the ground, maybe you will be okay. It doesn’t necessarily mean that it will get better, but if it is making you feel ill, do some yoga, go in the ground, do some healing, start looking into things. The spiritual change is going to be more intense, so don’t be afraid, dive in. Look at your life and start making changes.
