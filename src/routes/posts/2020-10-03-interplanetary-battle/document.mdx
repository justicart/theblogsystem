`In these uncertain times, planets had to choose sides. Parent against son. Brother against brother. Saturn and Jupiter joined Pluto in the East. Mars and Uranus hung out around the Moon. Neptune was still undecided. Mercury and Venus are nowhere to be seen.` Mars is probably still bumming around with Venus.

The Moon has a lot of nerve. I mean, he started this whole war, yet he won’t pick a side. The Moon is a low-level player. Just a pawn. Only one side will be victorious, and that side will have the Moon as a prize. He’s got a big ego. The Moon thinks he can conquer Pluto, but Pluto will defeat the Moon and take his water for his own.

The Moon is a big-mouth. He’s always calling Pluto names and saying they just need to talk it out, but Pluto knows the Moon is secretly building a giant army of mice in his silvery palace just waiting to conquer Pluto. Pluto is going to have to send his mice to take out the Moon’s mice.

Pluto isn’t going to take the Moon’s name-calling and hounding lying down. He’s got his own army of mice preparing for battle. Pluto is going to get you, Moon. You’re a dead man.

My brother is on the Moon’s side. He likes the idea of a world with no border control. He thinks it would be a free-for-all. He wants to be able to fly to Pluto without having to go through any checkpoints. The Moon has promised him if he joins his army he’ll be able to do that.

Mars is on Pluto’s side. He wants to be on the winning team. He says the Moon is a “pansy” and he’s going to “kick his butt.” Mars says he’s going to bring his army of red-hot lava to fight in Pluto’s war. He’s going to bring fire to the Moon’s icy home. He’s going to bring doom.

Neptune is still undecided. I think he’s going to join the Moon because he’s an Aquarius and they have the same sign. He doesn’t want the world to be divided. He’s afraid the war will cause everyone to form their own armies and take over the Earth. He’s afraid there will be no peace.

Uranus is Pluto’s best friend. I don’t know what he’s going to do. He won’t tell me. I think he’s going to join with Pluto.

Saturn is Pluto’s father. I don’t know what he’s going to do either. He always seems so sad and alone. He’s a Sagittarius. I think he’s going to join the Moon’s side. He’s a Pisces. He’s in the same sign as Neptune, so I think they’ll join together.

The Sun is Pluto’s brother. He’s a Leo. I’m a Gemini. The Sun and Pluto are both in a battle for power. Pluto is a Capricorn. I don’t know what side my brother is going to be on.

There’s a lot of tension in the air.

We’re waiting for the Moon to attack.

I’ll keep you posted.

Stay safe.
